= Handling Data Source Response Model Differences

== 1. What if the data source response data model is different from my schema?

If the data source response model differs from your schema, you can use **mappings** to align the data with your schema.

=== How to configure mappings

You need to define mappings that configure the **data input** (example) and map it to your schema. This can be achieved in two ways:

- **Script-based mappings**: Provide a mapping script to transform the incoming data model to match your schema.
- **UI-based mappings**: Use the UI to map columns and apply functional mappings to make the data compatible with your schema.

=== Script Instructions

You can refer to the detailed instructions on how to write a mapping script using the following link:

=== Example

Example mappings can either be script-based or configured in the UI, allowing you to flexibly handle discrepancies between the data source and your schema.
